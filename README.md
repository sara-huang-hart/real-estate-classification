# ðŸ“Œ Project Background 

Housing is a topic that holds significant business implications for investors, real estate professionals, and potential homeowners. Being able to forecast housing trends can help promote more well-informed decisions when regarding buying, selling, or even investing in properties. For individuals and businesses, these insights can become a useful tool to gain a competitive edge when navigating through the world of real estate. This project uses the USA Real Estate [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset/data) from Kaggle.
