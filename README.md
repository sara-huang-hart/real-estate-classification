# ðŸ“Œ Project Background 

Real estate is the largest asset class in the world. It holds significant business implications for investors, real estate professionals, and potential homeowners. Being able to forecast housing trends can help promote more well-informed decisions when regarding buying, selling, or even investing in properties. For individuals and businesses, these insights can become a useful tool to gain a competitive edge when navigating through the world of real estate. Understanding the relationship between the physical attributes of a property and its market value is important for both real estate professionals and prospective buyers. In This project uses the USA Real Estate [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset/data) from Kaggle.
